Objectives of report: To create a basic thermometer using Atmel328p

Methodology: Thermistor -> MCU -> 7 SEG
Program Method: 2 Interrupts with linear interpolation

Results: Working resistor tested range between 0-30 deg. cel. 

Analog to digital converters (or ADC) are electrical devices that convert from
an analog input voltage to a digital n-bit number. Many digital thermometers use
a thermistor (a resistor in which the resistance is a function of temperature)
and an ADC to display the temperature (using a digital display) of the
surrounding environment. This project seeks to investigate a method of creating
a thermometer using a thermistor, microcontroller, and a two-digit seven segment
display.

An AVR Atmel328p microcontroller was used as the logic control unit to interface
the thermistor to the seven segment display. The program that controls the
microcontroller uses interrupts to convert the input voltage from the thermistor
to the value that is displayed. Linear interpolation was used as the method to
compute the temperature "read" by the thermistor. The working assembly of this
project worked using the
