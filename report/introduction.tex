This report is divided into two sections; the first half is for program logic
and the second is for hardware. The software section will cover configuration
of the ATmega328p's timer for updating the seven-segment display and digit
multiplexing, the ADC for converting the thermistors voltage signal into
digital data and extracting the thermistor temperature from the data. The
hardware extion will cover setting up the Dragon programmer, powering the
Atmega and the ADC, seven-segment pin layout and setup, and connecting the
thermistor.
