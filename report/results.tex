\chapter{Testing The Thermometer}

The included thermometer design was tested using trial and error. No formal data
was measured as the purpose of the lab was to get the thermometer to show
changes in temperature. Pieces of ice were used to test the lower limits of the
thermometer. This was done by surrounding the thermistor with three pieces of
ice. After about $45$ seconds the seven segment display showed
$0^{\circ}\mathrm{C}$, a successful measurement.
